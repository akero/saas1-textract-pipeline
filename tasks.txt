Each CSV file is associated with a unique billId.
The userId is used as the partition key to group bills for a specific user.
The key and value from the CSV are stored as attributes within each item.
Needs userId, and for sortkey needs billId#key (combination of billid and key)

>1 Create a Lambda Function
The Lambda function will be triggered by an S3 object created event.
The function will:
Parse the S3 event to extract the bucket name, object key, and folder structure.
Download the CSV file from the specified S3 path.
Process the CSV data, converting it into DynamoDB item format.
Batch write the items to the DynamoDB table.

>2. S3 Event Configuration
Configure an S3 event source for the Lambda function.
Filter the events to only trigger when a new object is created in the specific folder (e.g., invoice-analysis).
